# Terraform Learning Repository

Welcome to my Terraform learning journey! This repository is a collection of Terraform configurations and examples as I explore the world of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Goals

My objectives with this repository are:

- **Master Terraform Core Concepts:** Understand providers, resources, variables, outputs, state management, and modules.
- **Deploy to Multiple Cloud Providers:** Practice deploying infrastructure to AWS, GCP (and potentially Azure) using Terraform.
- **Orchestrate Infrastructure:** Learn to create complex, multi-tier architectures and manage dependencies between resources.
- **Apply IaC Best Practices:** Implement modular design, version control, testing, and security within my Terraform workflows.

## Repository Structure

- `/examples`: Contains smaller, focused Terraform configurations demonstrating specific features or use cases.
- `/projects`: Houses larger, more comprehensive Terraform projects (e.g., building a VPC, deploying a web application).
- `/modules`: Reusable Terraform modules that encapsulate common infrastructure patterns.
- `/providers`: Examples of using various Terraform providers (AWS, GCP, etc.).

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Install Terraform: [https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
   - Set up Provider Credentials: Follow provider-specific guides for AWS, GCP, etc.
